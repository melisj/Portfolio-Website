            <p>
                I am Johannes, I am a game developer student who loves to create interesting games. <br>
                I am a second year student at the Hogeschool of Amsterdam, where I learn to make better games. <br> 
                Nearly every aspect of a game interests me, for example I like to make the art, sounds and the design. <br> 
                But I think the thing I like the most of creating games is to create complex systems with lines of code. <br>

                <br>

                Besides making games I also like to:

                <ul>
                    <li> Create 3D models in blender </li>
                    <li> Create Textures for 3D models </li>
                    <li> Drawing (2D Sprites) </li>
                </ul>

                This website's purpose will be to showcase my games I created in my one year as a game developer. <br>
                Here you will find two school projects and one project I started on my own.
