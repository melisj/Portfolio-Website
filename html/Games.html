            <h2>P2P Game<hr></h2>
            <p>
                I made this game in unity to learn more about multiplayer games and how they are created. <br>
                To do this I started from scratch with the UdpClient of the .net framework. <br>
                The purpose of this game was to create a P2P network and to test out the networking code.

            <p>
                This tool was made for generating meshes on bezier curves. <br>
                The tool grew into a track tool which allowed trains to drive on it. <br>
                The project was also created to make custom editors within unity and learn how they work. <br>

            <p>
                Solimarked is a website/IOT product created for the corona pandemic. <br>
                The aim of this product was to create a way to help people with their groceries. <br>
                Volunteers on the website could help with orders send by the people who are vulnerable in these times. <br>

                <br>

                The webiste was created to help the visually impaired people get products, <br>
                this is why the website has a high contrast theme. <br>

                <br>

                The IOT product was meant to count people within a store and send this info to people at home, <br>
                so they could make a decision to based on the color given by their IOT lamp. <br>

                <br>

                The google home mini was also included to help with people that are completely blind. <br>
                Their orders could be interpreted by the google mini and send to our server for processing. <br>

            <p>
                TraffiX is a game where you have to operate the traffic lights to safely guide traffic to their destination. <br>
                The only control you have are the traffic lights. <br>
                With these lights you have to manage the traffic flow by ordering the light to go green or red. <br>

            <h2>Boat Tracker<hr></h2>
            <p>
  
                Boat tracker is a solo project I created to keep track of rowing boats. <br>
                The boat would contain a arduino with a gps module and would send this information to the server. <br>
                The website would show the current position of the boat and the route the boat took on the given time. <br>
