                <ul>
                        <li> Roof Runner was the first ever game I created as a school project. </li>
                        <li> TraffiX was a game I created in the summer holiday. </li>
                        <li> Crystall was also a school project and was made to be demo for a game concept. </li>

                   Roof Runner is an endless runner where you have to dodge obstacles on rooftops. <br>
                   In this sidescrolling adventure you will have to run from the police as a robber.  <br>

                   You will have to fight your way out to freedom with your only weapon available, a sock boomerang <br>

                   <br>

                   /!\ if you get stuck in the level you might have to duck in order to dodge certain obstacles. /!\ <br>
